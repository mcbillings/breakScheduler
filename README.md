# breakScheduler
This program will take a schedule for a given day and assign 15 minute and 30 minute breaks according to the duration of their shift without allowing overlapping breaks for employees within the same department.

Current functionality:
-reads employees from a file containing their start, end, and department
-calculates duration of shift, number of rest breaks and meal breaks
-schedules breaks depending on number of rest breaks and meals breaks in accordance to California law without overlapping with employees in the same department
-creates csv output file of schedule that converts time from hourportion to hhmm format
